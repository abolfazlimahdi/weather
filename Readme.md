# Weather Project

## Introduction
In this project, I will create an incremental application. In each phase, I will enhance the application so it would be useful when you are in search of the implementation a certain technology.

The phases I have in mind for this application are:
1. Java without any library and architecture
2. Java with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, and MVP architecture
3. Java with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, RX-Java and MVP architecture
4. Kotlin with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, RX-Kotlin and MVP architecture
5. Kotlin with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, Coroutines and MVVM architecture
5. Kotlin with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, Coroutines, Compose and MVVM architecture
6. Kotlin with Retrofit, Dagger 2, Room, Coroutines, Compose and MVI architecture

Each phase will have its own dedicated branch. I will also publish an article about each phase and how did I convert from one phase to the other one.
